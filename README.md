# Invalid CSS Pseudo-class Selector Bug

This repository demonstrates a common CSS error where an invalid pseudo-class selector is used, preventing the intended styling from being applied.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous CSS code using the nonexistent `::maybe-hover` pseudo-class. The `solution.css` file offers an alternative using a standard hover pseudo-class or demonstrates how to implement the similar functionality using JavaScript.
