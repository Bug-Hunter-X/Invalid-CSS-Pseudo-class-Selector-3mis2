The following CSS rule attempts to style an element based on a nonexistent pseudo-class selector:

```css
div::maybe-hover {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

This will not cause a runtime error, but it will have no effect.  The `::maybe-hover` pseudo-class does not exist in CSS.  The intended effect may be achievable using JavaScript event listeners instead.
